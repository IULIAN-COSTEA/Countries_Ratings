**Countries Credit Ratings Predictor Tool**

**Author:** Iulian Costea

---

## üìå Executive Summary
The **Countries Ratings** project is designed to predict **Country Credit Ratings** and **Country Outlook** for the **current year** and the **next year** for **any country worldwide**.

This information is critical for companies, institutional investors, and individual investors seeking new investment opportunities and assessing different countries' investment attractiveness and associated risk levels.

Predictions follow the rating scales provided by agencies like **Moody‚Äôs**, **Fitch**, and **S&P**. Historical credit rating data from **S&P**, **Moody‚Äôs**, and **DBRS** has been used for model training. Additional macroeconomic and demographic data has been collected from **World Bank** and **IMF**.

---

## üéØ Rationale
- Not all countries have official credit ratings.
- Even when available, ratings are often updated infrequently.
- This tool provides **timely predictions** of ratings and outlooks for **current and near-future years**.

This makes the tool valuable for investors who require **up-to-date insights** into a country‚Äôs investment profile.

---

## ‚ùì Research Question
Can we predict a country‚Äôs **Credit Rating** and **Outlook** for the current and next year using macroeconomic and demographic indicators?

- Initial data coverage: **1960‚Äì2023**
- Training period after cleaning: **1980‚Äì2023**

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Extract, aggregate, normalize historical country ratings.
   - Map ratings to numerical values (**ratingn**).
   - Merge with macroeconomic and demographic data.
   - Clean consolidated DataFrame.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Correlation analysis + removal of multicollinear features.
   - Target imputation (`ffill`, `bfill`).
   - Feature imputation with multiple strategies: `polynomial_fill`, `mean_fill`, `rolling_average`, `ARIMA`, global fallback.
   - PCA for dimensionality reduction (first principal components).
   - Creation of lagging features *(work in progress).*

3. **Modeling**
   - Baseline: **DecisionTreeClassifier** for **ratingn** (multiclass) and **outlook**.
   - Hyperparameter optimization using **RandomizedSearchCV**.
   - Tested models: **RandomForest**, **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, **CatBoost**.
   - Evaluations with **Confusion Matrix**, **AUC/ROC Curves**.

---

## üìà Results

### Overall Technical Findings
- Feature imputation strategies improved data coverage significantly.
- PCA reduced dimensionality without major performance losses.
- **Class imbalance** in outlook prediction remains a key challenge.

## üöÄ Next Steps

- [ ] Address class imbalance in *outlook* prediction (e.g., SMOTE, class weights).
- [ ] Refine lagging features from *outlook*.
- [ ] Improve imputation techniques.
- [ ] Finalize regression models for feature predictions (current + next year).
- [ ] Add interpretability layer (e.g., SHAP values).

Countries Credit Ratings Predictor Tool

#### Executive summary
The project **Countries Ratings** is designed to predict **Country Credit Ratings** and **Country outlook** for the **current year** and **next year** for **any country in the world**.

This information is important for companies, insitutional investors and individual investors that are looking for new investment opportunities and are continously assessing different countries' investment attractivity and their associated risks level.
Countries' credit ratings provided by the models in this project are following the rating scales provided by agencies like Moody‚Äôs, Fitch or S&P. For model training historical credit ratings information from **S&P**, **Moody's** and **DBRS** has been used. 

Additional information related to macroeconomic indications and demographics has been collected from **Worldbank** and **IMF**.

#### Rationale
Access to countries credit ratings although are released as public information, are not available for all countries and also are not alway updated. That's because credit rating agencies do not provide credit ratings for all countries. 

Moreover, for the countries that are covered by the credit ratings the update period are sometime long and the most updated credit rating is not available for the present or near future. 

This project is a useful tool for the investors becuase provides insights into any country investment profile at any given time in the near future. (current and next year).

#### Research Question
The tool is predicting the **Country Credit Rating** and **Country Outlook** for the **current year** and **near future (next year)**.


#### Data Sources
The project uses the following data sources and datasets:

- **Countries credit Ratings** - Information collected from the following source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_credit_rating) 
  
- **Countries CPI** - Source: [FMI](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2025/april)

- **Countries Government Debt** - Source:[FMI](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2025/april)

- **Countries Macroeconomic Indicators** - Source: [WorldBank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)

- Initial historical data covers period 1960-2023. However, due to missing data the period used for training is **training period 1980-2023**.

#### Methodology
Below a summary of the used methodology:

- Country Credit Ratings extraction, agregation and normalization - Historical Country Credit Ratings and Country Outlook have been collected from different creding Agencies. Data has been cleaned, agregated, normalized and mapped to a new numerical column **ratingn**.

- All datasets have been transformed, cleaned and merged into a single Dataframe for proper processing

- Conducted **data cleaning** on the new consolidated dataframe

- Conducted **correlation analysis** and **multi-colinearity** processing (by removing all multi-colinear features)

- Conducted **data processing and some imputation** (using .ffill() and .bfill()) on target columns **ratingn** and **outlook**.

- Conducted data imputation on features columns using following techniques: polynomial_fill, .ffill(), .bfill(), mean_fill, rolling_average, arima and Global Fallback for any remaining NaNs

- Conducted **PCA Analysis** and selected **First Principal Components**

- Create **lagging features** (work in progess)

- Build **Regression Models** for next 2 years predictions (work in progess)

- Build **Classification Baseline model** for *multiclass classification* using **DecisionTreeClassifier** for **two targets** Country Ratings (*ratingn*) and Country Outlook (*outlook*)

- Experimentation using **RandomSearchCV**(tried also SearchCV) and different classification models(*Randomforest*, *XGBoost*, *LightGBM* and *CatBoost* )

- Selected the best model and calculated Confusion matrix and AUC/ROC curves for both targets
